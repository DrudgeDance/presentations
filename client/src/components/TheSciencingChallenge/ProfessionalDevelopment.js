        The Sciencing Challenge invites students to pitch their ideas to a panel of influential industry leaders. This event provides an opportunity for students to connect their research with practical solutions in the Dairy Science industry. Each team will have 5 minutes to present their concepts to the panel, followed by 5 minutes of Q&A from the judges. Ideas can range from products and services to management solutions in dairy science. After all the teams have presented, the judges will deliberate and determine the winner. The grand prize is $1,000!        </p>
